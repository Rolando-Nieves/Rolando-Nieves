Hi, I’m Rolando Nieves!

I’m passionate about videogames and always eager to learn new things, especially in the realm of programming. Currently, I’m diving deep into Java with IntelliJ, and my ultimate goal is to master the Java + Spring + Angular stack. I'm also an English teacher with a love for helping others learn and grow!

I’m on the lookout for exciting opportunities to collaborate with companies that value dynamic and creative backend developers. If you’re interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me at nieves.rolando94@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
