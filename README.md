# Hi, Iâ€™m Rolando Nieves

I'm interested in videogames and learning new things related to programming. I'm currently learning Java with IntelliJ, and my goal is to master the Java + Spring + Angular stack. 

I'm looking to collaborate with companies that are seeking dynamic and creative backend developers.

Feel free to reach out to me at nieves.rolando94@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-rolando-n-3aa3811a2/).

Fun fact: I'm an English teacher too and love teaching others!
